<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The user will input a business name or type along with a location that is either by city, zip code, or by coordinates and a list of businesses related to their search will be returned.
Once the user clicks on a business that they would like to see more info on, they will be brought to the results page where they are able to see more info about the business they searched.
They are able to see info such as the rating of the business, the address, whether they are open or closed at current time, the phone number, and a map of where that business is.
If the user wishes to sign in with Google, they have access to features such as saving businesses as favorites. The user can then view their favorites in the favorites page and select a saved business they want to see more info on.
They will then be brought to the results apge with info on the business and users can choose to unstar a business by click on the star right by the business name. 
This will then remove the business from their favorites list.</p>
